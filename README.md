Oh, hi Bryan! Are you ready to do this?

## Rules of development
So, from now on we will be disciplined about development. If we work on a feature or any change, we will make a new branch.
This branch is your personal workspace. You do not go into other people's branches unless explicitly asked to.

We have a master branch. This is the branch that will reflect what is in production. Therefore we will be *very* careful about what code we push into the master branch.

To push code into the master branch, we will - from the branch we are working on - create a *pull request*. This will *pull* the code from the working branch into the master branch.

A pull request is a way of stopping, looking at the code, discuss the code and get reviews from coworkers/seniors. This way we control and accept every single line of code written before pushing it to production. To make this work, make sure that a *pull request*:

- Does one and only one thing (oh so hard to keep it to that)
- Is as short as possible
- Spans as few files as possible

Yeah? ;)
